# Tweetanium

Tweetanium is an example application showcasing a multi-platform approach for building applications
on the Titanium platform.

## Running Tweetanium Mobile

For Tweetanium Mobile, you will need to provide the consumer key and consumer secret values for a Twitter
application that has been authorized by Twitter for xAuth access to its APIs.  If your application has not
been "blessed" for xAuth by Twitter, [follow these steps](http://dev.twitter.com/pages/xauth) to request
access for your application.

Once your app has been prepared for xAuth, copy Resources/tweetanium/config/config.example.js to config.js,
and provide your oAuth keys.
